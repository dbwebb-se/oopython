# Exercise 1.1 (1 points)
#
# Create a new file, for creating classes in, call it **classes.py**. In
# classes.py create the class Cat. Add the following instance attributes in
# the Cat class constructor:
# - `eye_color`
# - `name`
# Add a paramater for each attribute in the constructor definition.
# Create a *get*-method for each attribute.
#
# Dont forget to import the file!
#
# In the code below create a new variable called `cat1` and initiate it with
# a new *Cat object*.
# Give the object the eye color "black" and the name "Gordon".
#
# Answer with the string "My cats name is `name` and has `eye_color` eyes.",
# use the get-methods to retrieve the values from the object in cat1.
#
# Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.

# Expand your Cat class with the instance attribute `lives_left`.
# Also add a *set*- and *get*-method for the attribute.
# In the constructor, give `lives_left` a default value of `-1` if no other
# value is sent to the constructor.
#
# In the code below use the set-method on cat1 to change the value to `1`.
