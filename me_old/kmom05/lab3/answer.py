# Lab 4 - Recursion

# everything this lab will go through and much more.

# Section 1. Simple recursion
#
# Practice on creating recursive functions.
#



# """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# Exercise 1.1
#
# Create a recursive function in the code below that calculates the sum of
# the numbers `16` up to `35`.
#
# Answer with the sum.
#
# Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
#






ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# I will now test your answer - change false to true to get a hint.
dbwebb.assert_equal("1.1", ANSWER, False)

# """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# Exercise 1.2
#
# Create a recursive function in the code below that calculates the sum of
# the numbers in the list `[4, 5, 6, 11, 9, 1, 2, 3, 8]`.
# If its an empty list return `0`.
#
# Answer with the sum.
#
# Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
#






ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# I will now test your answer - change false to true to get a hint.
dbwebb.assert_equal("1.2", ANSWER, False)

# """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# Exercise 1.3
#
# Create a recursive function in the code below that searches a list for a
# number and returns the index of the number.
# Find the index of `11` in the list `[4, 5, 6, 11, 9, 1, 2, 3, 8]`.
# If the number cant be found, return -1.
#
# Answer with the index.
#
# Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
#

# Exercise 1.4
#
# Use the function from the previous assignment to find the number `16` in
# the list `[4, 5, 6, 11, 9, 1, 2, 3, 8]`.
#
# Answer with the index.
#
# Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.

# Exercise 1.5
#
# Create a recursive function in the code below that calculates `5` to the
# power of `5`.
#
# Answer with the result.
#
# Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
#






ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# I will now test your answer - change false to true to get a hint.
dbwebb.assert_equal("1.5", ANSWER, False)

# """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
# Exercise 1.6
#
# Create a recursive function in the code below that turns a string
# backwards. Turn the string "Frontwards" backwards.
#
# Answer with the backward string.
#
# Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
#






ANSWER = "Replace this text with the variable holding the answer."

# I will now test your answer - change false to true to get a hint.
